# libewa

Hello, I am libewa, aka minutix. I mainly try to code apps in Swift, but then they somehow don't work. 

My current projects are:

- [libewa/hausaufgaben](https://github.com/libewa/hausaufgaben)
- my GitHub Pages site (https://libewa.github.io)

I use a Surface Pro X, a self-built gaming PC and a MacBook Pro.

Also PLEASE help me solve all the issues in my  repository, I have no clue why they're happening.
