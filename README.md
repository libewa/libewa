Hi, I am Linus, a student from Germany. I write code as a hobby, but don't really tend to finish projects.
My favorite programming language is [Swift], mainly for the SwiftUI library. I am also trying to get into [Rust] and [Deno] (a strict ECMAScript/TypeScript runtime from the creator of NodeJS). This choice often starts arguments with Nils ([nonline]), who has made the opposite choice of using non-strict CommonJS and Python (and seems not to use compiler languages at all???).

<!-- TODO: Systems -->

I am currently working on [my website](https://libewa.xyz), and there are also a lot of other half-finished projects, which I might pick up again.

Together with [Bimi124], I also have competed in a fischertechnik robotics cup before, and we are currently working on our second generation line follower.

I also took part in the Fall 2023 "Hack to the Future" Hackathon, where my team created a web app to navigate a theme park.

My preferred contact method is GitHub Issues, as spam bots don't (yet) post there.
